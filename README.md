# morris-method-second-order
The New Morris Method was proposed by Campolongo and Braddock [Reliab. Engng Syst. Saf. 64 (1999) 1] as an extension of the Morris Method [Technometrics 33 (1991) 161] to include estimation of two-factor interaction effects.

I made this code to sample and calculate the sensitivitiy analysis with two factors interaction effects using a solution of handcuffed prisoners proposed by Campolongo and based on the work of Mendelshon NS. Handcuffed designs. discrete mathematics 1977.
